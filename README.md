# Kana-Kilo

This is a web app to help learn the Japanese Hiragana and Katakana characters.

This takes *heavy* inspiration from 
[the type-kana project](https://github.com/fleon/type-kana) and
[this fork](https://github.com/Cody-Duncan/type-kana) of that project.
At the time of this project's start these projects were no longer being maintained,
and I took this as an opportunity to learn how to build a website. 

Enjoy!
